Introduction
------------

The main branch of this repository consists of a `python 3` script for downloading the dataset.

The downloading script's dependencies are:

* [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)
* [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/)


Downloading the dataset
------------

### Preliminary steps
Before downloading, make sure to have at least `250 GB` of free disk space available! Make sure to have a recent version of `python 3` installed.

### Download script
If you have git installed, simply clone this repository by

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bbrosint/3dprintingdataset.git
```

If you do not have git installed, simply [download](https://github.com/bbrosint/3dprintingdataset/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the repository as `.zip` archive from github and extract the files locally.

Install the dependencies via 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Operation
Open a shell and execute the script with the `python` interpreter:

```bash
python download_dataset.py
```

This will download all available files. To restrict the download to certain files, use the console arguments:

```bash
python download_dataset.py -s s,l -f gcode
```

This will only download `gcodes`of small and large sized 3d models.

The original 3d model files were collected by `Zhou` and `Jacobson` and published as the [thingy10k](https://ten-thousand-models.appspot.com) dataset.

[Blender3d](https://blender.org) was used for reviewing the original dataset.

[Slic3r](https://slic3r.org/) and [printrun](https://github.com/kliment/Printrun) (gcoder) were used for generating the `G-Codes`.

The app for viewing the dataset was developed with the [Vue3](https://vuejs.org) framework with the help of [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org).
